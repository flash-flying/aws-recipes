# Some AWS Recipies

These are basic intros/recipes to AWS APIs using boto3. PRs welcome.

An ideal doc should: 

- Describe, briefly, the purpose of the service it covers and when to choose it vs similar AWS services
- Include instructions for any necessary setup, using only boto3 (no AWS console)

Code guidelines:

- Every code snippet include all necessary imports
- No dependencies other than Python stdlib and boto3
- Every code snippet can be copy/pasted into python shell and run correctly
